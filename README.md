# MerkleAirdrop
This project shows how to implement a smart contract for an airdrop that uses a Merkle tree for whitelisting addresses and learn how to generate a Merkle root from a list of eligible addresses, implement a Solidity contract that verifies claims against this Merkle root, and manage the airdrop process
