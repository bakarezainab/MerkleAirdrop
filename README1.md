# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

# MerkleAirdrop
This project shows how to implement a smart contract for an airdrop that uses a Merkle tree for whitelisting addresses and learn how to generate a Merkle root from a list of eligible addresses, implement a Solidity contract that verifies claims against this Merkle root, and manage the airdrop process
